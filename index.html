The history of the city has been strongly influenced by people of different nations and religions, namely by Austrians, Croats, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Serbs[6] and Slovaks (in alphabetical order).[7] The city was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary, a part of the larger Habsburg Monarchy territories,[8] from 1536 to 1783 and has been home to many Slovak, Hungarian and German historical figures.
